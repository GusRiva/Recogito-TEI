# Recogito-TEI Working Group

At present Recogito supports import of plaintext (.txt extension) and TEI/XML encoded text (.xml extension). However, text and annotations are transformed into TEI only partially. Many users of Recogito and Pelagios Commons tools have found the transition between the annotated text in Recogito and the final TEI result very useful for developing Digital Scholarly Editions (DSE). This Working Group aims at improving interoperability the inport and export of TEI encoded texts and facilitate the integration with publishing solutions such as CETEIcean and ED/Jekyll.

## How to Contribute?

The first task that the members of the team should tackle is a comprenhensive review of input problems from TEI into Recogito and of output problems from Recogito to TEI after geolocalization and the annotation of entities. In order to do this we can review this [file](https://github.com/hdcaicyt/Recogito-TEI/blob/master/Ruy_Diaz-La_Argentina_Manuscrita.tei.xml) (it is too big at the moment so it is only displayed as raw text, maybe we need a sample) and a [document](https://github.com/hdcaicyt/Recogito-TEI/blob/master/recogito-download-sample.tei.xml#L18=) with currently TEI supported elements for input. 

If you want to comment or review a line of code, click on a line number so you get the little button with an ellipse on it, and then click on that, one of the options is "Reference in new issue", so you can make an issue with a link to that line or section of the document. Your issue should have a clear title and **focus only on one problem/suggestion**. So open as many issues as you need! You are allowed to use labels, mention people and assign tasks. In all exchanges, try to be constructive and nice to your colleagues.
